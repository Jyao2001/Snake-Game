    changelog - 1/15/2020: added code to say why the game quits, fixed the # generator code
                1/22/2020: separated some functions into sub-functions

    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////Guideline Check////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
✓   1. Is there a bug in the board drawing code that sometimes makes the snake disappear? If there is, find it and fix it.
    There may be other bugs in either the Logic or Draw routines; find any and fix them

✓   2. Add the capability of having more than one fruit on the board.
    Create some variable and set it to a value of 2 to 5, say, to represent the number of fruits that should be on the board.
    You can either hardwire the number of fruits or ask the user for a number at the beginning of the program. Create a new fruit for each fruit that is eaten.

✓   3.Add an option to let the user play another game when he loses rather than just exiting the program when the user fails.

✓   4.Add an input option P that pauses the game and waits for the user to hit any other key before proceeding.

✓   5.When the program first starts, print out some instructions for using the game to the user.

✓   6. Add an option to the game that makes the player lose the game if the snake hits a wall.

✓   7. Make the input routine case-insensitive.

    8. Add any other features you think are valuable/interesting, and note in the comments at the top of the program what you added and why.
