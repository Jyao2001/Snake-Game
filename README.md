This is a redesign of the infamous Snake Game. Added some new features/fixed bugs such as: 


Bug in the board drawing code that sometimes makes the snake disappear.

Capability of having more than one fruit on the board.

Option to let the user play another game when he loses.

Input option P that pauses the game and waits for the user to hit any other key before proceeding.

Print out some instructions for using the game to the user.

Option that makes the player lose the game if the snake hits a wall.

Make the input routine case-insensitive.
